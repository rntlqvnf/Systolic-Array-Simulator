# Systolic-Array-Simulator

## Instruction
- RHM src dst N (N cycle)

Read N vectors from Host Memory to Unified Buffer

- WHM src dst N (N cycle)

Write N vectors from Unified Buffer to Host Memory

- RW.{U} addr N (N * N / 64 cycle)

Read N vectors weight from DRAM to Weight FIFO

U option means Unfold (convolution lowering)

- MMC.{SOU} src dst N (If MM, 2 * N -1 cycle. If conv, 2 * (weight_size + N â€“ 1)^2 - 1)

Matrix Multiply / Convolution with N input vectors

  - S option means Switch (Switch MMU weight buffer)
  - O option means Overwrite (Overwrite result on accumulator)
  - U option means Unfold (convolution lowering)

- ACT.{FP} src dst N {M} (N cycle)

Activate N vectors (ReLU and something) and write to Unified Buffer (M is kernel matrix size)

  - F option means Fold (Fold unfolded result matrix)
  - P option means Pooling

- NOP

- HLT
